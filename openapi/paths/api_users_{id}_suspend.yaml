    This endpoint allows the client to suspend a user.


    The user associated with the API key must have any 'admin' or 'moderator'
    role.


    This specified user will be assigned the 'suspended' role. Suspending a user
    will stop the

    user from posting new posts and comments. It doesn't delete any of the
    user's content, just

    prevents them from creating new content while suspended. Users are not
    notified of their suspension

    in the UI, so if you want them to know about this, you must notify them.
