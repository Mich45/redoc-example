  description: >-
    This endpoint allows the client to unpublish all of the articles and

    comments created by a user.


    The user associated with the API key must have any 'admin' or 'moderator'
    role.


    This specified user's articles and comments will be unpublished and will no
    longer be

    visible to the public. They will remain in the database and will set back to
    draft status

    on the specified user's  dashboard. Any notifications associated with the
    specified user's

    articles and comments will be deleted.


    Note this endpoint unpublishes articles and comments asychronously: it will
    return a 204 NO CONTENT

    status code immediately, but the articles and comments will not be
    unpublished until the

    request is completed on the server.
